1. All three objects are on the desk; the drawer is closed. This is the very initial state of the task. Since at least one object: the blue cube, is completely left of the arm's base, we can open the drawer, and put the blue cube into the drawer. The immediate next subtask is to open the drawer, thus: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.

2. We are in position to grip the middle drawer's handle, thus: close the gripper to grip then drawer handle.

3. We have grasped onto the handle, thus: pull the drawer open.

4. We have pulled the drawer open. Next, we need to start putting objects into the drawer, thus: release the gripper.

5. We need to start getting into position to grasp the blue cube, the only object of the three distant enough from the drawer to safely grasp without collision, thus: return to the home position.

6. We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.

7. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube.

8. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper to align with grasp angle.

9. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is rotated to align with the grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.

10. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp.

11. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is closed and grasped onto the cube, thus: raise the gripper such that the gripper and the the blue cube clear the height of the edge of the drawer.

12. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper and object is raised so as to clear the height of the edge of the drawer, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is above the opened drawer.

13. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release object into the drawer.

14. Next, we need to close the drawer, move the remaining object left, open the drawer, pick and place the objects into the drawer, and close the drawer again. To start the close drawer protocol, it is best to not have the gripper have a roll; We also want to move leftward, because the close drawer protocol happens by pushing the drawer in from the left side. Returning to the home position both resets the roll to neutral, and moves gripper to the left, thus: return to the home position.

15. We have now moved such that the gripper is above the open drawer and can move down to be on the same level as the open drawer without collision if we move diagonally down to the left, thus: move down the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer, and tilt to the left, to prepare to push the drawer close.

16. The gripper is moved and rotated such that it can push the drawer close, thus: push the drawer close.

17. We should now proceed to move the tennis ball and the red cube left. We have just closed the drawer, and want to return to an upright position, thus: move gripper horizontally to the left.

18. We want to continue to return to an upright position after closing the drawer to facilitate further action, thus: return to the home position.

19. We are now in the general area above both the tennis ball and the red cube. We need to move both the tennis ball and the red cube left. The order doesn't matter, but it is preferrable to start with the object further back. Let us start with the tennis cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the tennis ball.

20. We have lowered and pitched the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the tennis ball. Since the tennis ball is a round object, there's no need to rotate to align grasp angle. We follow the move object left protocol, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasping the tennis ball.

21. We have lowered the gripper and are prepared to grasp, thus: close the gripper to grasp onto the tennis ball.

22. We have grasped onto the tennis ball, and dragging leftward will not collide with another object, thus: drag the tennis ball leftward along the desk.

23. We have now dragged the object leftward along the desk, thus: open the gripper to let go the tennis ball.

24. We have opened the gripper, thus: raise the gripper vertically to be ~5cm above the tennis ball.

25. We want to perform the move object left protocol on the red cube. We need to first be in the general area above the red cube. We can do so by moving to the home position, thus: move to the home position.

26. We follow the move object left protocol, and we are now in the general area above the red cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the red cube.

27. We have lowered and pitched the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the red cube. The red cube is rotated, and we need to rotate the gripper to align the grasp angle, thus: rotate the gripper to align with grasp angle.

28. We have rotated the gripper to align with grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasping the red cube.

29. We have lowered the gripper to prepare for grasp, thus: close the gripper to grasp onto the red cube.

30. We have grasped onto the red cube, and dragging leftward will not collide with another object, thus: drag the red cube leftward along the desk.

31. We have dragged the object leftward along the desk, thus: open the gripper to let go the red cube.

32. We have opened the gripper and let go the red cube, thus: raise the gripper vertically to be ~5cm above the red cube.

33. We now need to prepare to open the drawer, and pick and place the red cube and tennis ball into the drawer, thus: go to the home position.

34. We are now at the home position, thus: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.

35. We are now in position to grasp the handle of the middle drawer, thus close the gripper to grasp the drawer's handle.

36. We have grasped the drawer's handle, thus: move leftward to pull the drawer open.

37. We have pulled the drawer open, thus: release the gripper to let go of the drawer's handle.

38. We have released the gripper, thus: return to the home position.

39. Now we need to pick and place the tennis ball and the red cube into the drawer. Again, we start with the tennis ball. We are not quite in the general area above the tennis ball, thus: move left to be in the general area above the tennis ball.

40. We are now in the general area above the tennis ball, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the tennis ball.

41. We have now lowered and pitched the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the tennis ball, which is round, and requires no alignment for grasp, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasping the tennis ball.

42. We have lowered the gripper and are prepared to grasp the tennis ball, thus: close the gripper to grasp the tennis ball.

43. We have grasped onto the tennis ball, thus: raise the gripper such that the gripper and the the tennis ball clear the height of the edge of the drawer.

44. We have raised the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer, thus: move right to be above the opened drawer.

45. The gripper with the tennis ball are above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the tennis ball into the drawer.

46. Now we need to pick and place the red cube into the drawer. The gripper is not rotated (its pitch has changed twice, but is at a relatively neutral position after these changes), so we don't return to the home position, but instead move directly to the general area above the red cube, thus: move left to be in the general area above the red cube.

47. We are in the general area above the red cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the red cube.

48. We have lowered and pitched the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the red cube. The red cube is not rotated, and its grasp angle is aligned with the gripper's orientation, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasping the red cube.

49. We have lowered the gripper and are prepared for grasping the red cube, thus: close the gripper to grasp onto the red cube.

50. We have closed the gripper and grasped onto the red cube, thus: raise the gripper such that the gripper and the red cube clear the height of the edge of the drawer.

51. The gripper and the red red cube are raised to clear the height of the edge of the drawer, thus: move right to be above the opened drawer.

52. We are above the opened drawer with the red cube, thus: open the gripper to release the red cube into the drawer.

53. We have released the red cube into the drawer. Now we need to close the drawer. The gripper isn't rotated, thus: move leftward so that the gripper can later travel down without collision and push the drawer close.

54. We have moved leftward so that the gripper can later travel down without collision and push the drawer close, thus: lower the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer, and tilt to the left, to prepare to push the drawer close.

55. We have lowered the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer, and tilted to the left, and are in position to push the drawer close, thus: move gripper to the right to push the drawer close.

56. We have pushed the drawer close, and then want to return to an upright position to end the task, thus: move left horizontally.

57. We have move left horizontally, we can now move to the home position, thus: return to the home position.

58. There's no objects on the table, the middle drawer closed, and the robot in home position, thus: end.
