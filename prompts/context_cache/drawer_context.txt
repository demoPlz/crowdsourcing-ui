Round 1: Description bank

1. All three objects are on the desk; the drawer is closed. This is the very initial state of the task. Since at least one object—the blue cube—is completely left of the arm’s base, we can open the drawer and put the blue cube into the drawer. The immediate next subtask is to open the drawer, thus: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.

2. We are in position to grip the middle drawer’s handle, thus: close the gripper to grip the drawer handle.

3. We have grasped onto the handle, thus: pull the drawer open.

4. We have pulled the drawer open. Next, we need to start putting objects into the drawer, thus: release the gripper.

5. We need to start getting into position to grasp the blue cube, the only object of the three distant enough from the drawer to safely grasp without collision, thus: return to the home position.

6. We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.

7. We follow the pick-and-place protocol, and the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the blue cube.

8. We follow the pick-and-place protocol, and the gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical to be ~3 cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper to align with grasp angle.

9. We follow the pick-and-place protocol, and the gripper is rotated to align with the grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.

10. We follow the pick-and-place protocol, and the gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp.

11. We follow the pick-and-place protocol, and the gripper is closed and grasped onto the cube, thus: raise the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer.

12. We follow the pick-and-place protocol, and the gripper and object are raised so as to clear the height of the edge of the drawer, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is above the opened drawer.

13. We follow the pick-and-place protocol, and the gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the blue cube into the drawer.

14. Next, we need to process the remaining objects. Since the ball might be directly placeable, we attempt it first, thus: return to the home position.

15. The drawer is open with the blue cube inside; the arm is at home. We need to pick the ball, thus: move to the general area above the tennis ball.

16. The gripper is over the ball’s general area, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the ball.

17. The gripper is ~3 cm above the ball and pitched vertical, thus: rotate to align with grasp angle.

18. The gripper is aligned, thus: lower to prepare for grasp.

19. The gripper is positioned to grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp the ball.

20. The ball is grasped, thus: raise (translation-only) to clear the drawer edge height.

21. The gripper and ball are raised, thus: move (translation-only) to be above the opened drawer.

22. While above the drawer, alignment looks marginal (risk of collision with the drawer lip), thus: back off from the drawer to reassess.

23. We have backed away; to reset safely, thus: return to the home position.

24. We still need to put the ball into the drawer, thus: move again to the general area above the ball.

25. The gripper is above the ball, thus: lower and pitch to ~3 cm above and regrasp the ball (close gripper).

26. The ball is firmly grasped, thus: raise to clear the drawer edge.

27. The gripper and ball are raised, thus: move (translation-only) to be above the opened drawer.

28. The gripper is above the opened drawer with proper clearance, thus: open gripper to release the ball into the drawer.

29. The ball is now in the drawer with the blue cube; the drawer remains open. We still have the red cube near the drawer that is not directly safe to place, thus: return to the home position.

30. We need to move the red cube left per the move-object-left protocol, thus: move to the general area above the red cube.

31. The gripper is above the red cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the cube.

32. The gripper is lowered and pitched, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to align with the grasp angle.

33. The gripper is aligned, thus: lower to prepare for grasp.

34. The gripper is positioned to grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp the red cube.

35. The red cube is grasped. Dragging straight left risks minor collision with nearby items, thus: move slightly backward to create a clear leftward path.

36. Clearance achieved, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk to bring the cube entirely to the left of the arm base.

37. The cube has been repositioned left; per protocol, thus: open the gripper to release the cube in the left area.

38. The cube is released; to continue the strategy, thus: lift slightly and return to the home position.

39. With the red cube now safely left of the base, we can place it directly into the open middle drawer, thus: move to the general area above the red cube.

40. The gripper is over the red cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the cube.

41. The gripper is lowered and pitched, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to align with the grasp angle.

42. The gripper is aligned, thus: lower to prepare for grasp.

43. The gripper is positioned to grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp the red cube.

44. The red cube is grasped, thus: raise (translation-only) the gripper to clear the height of the drawer edge.

45. Clearance achieved, thus: move (translation-only) to be above the opened drawer.

46. The gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the red cube into the drawer.

47. All items are now in the middle drawer and the drawer is open, thus: execute the close-drawer protocol by moving down to the drawer front and pushing the drawer closed.

48. The drawer is closed and the task is complete, thus: return to the home position.

36. Clearance achieved, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk to bring the cube entirely to the left of the arm base.

37. The cube has been repositioned left; per protocol, thus: open the gripper to release the cube in the left area.

38. The cube is released; to continue the strategy, thus: lift slightly and return to the home position.

39. With the red cube now safely left of the base, we can place it directly into the open middle drawer, thus: move to the general area above the red cube.

40. The gripper is over the red cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the cube.

41. The gripper is lowered and pitched, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to align with the grasp angle.

45. Clearance achieved, thus: move (translation-only) to be above the opened drawer.

46. The gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the red cube into the drawer.

47. All items are now in the middle drawer and the drawer is open, thus: execute the close-drawer protocol by moving down to the drawer front and pushing the drawer closed.

48. The drawer is closed and the task is complete, thus: return to the home position.

49. The gripper is holding the red cube near the open middle drawer; the ball and blue cube are already inside. To ensure safe placement, thus: translate and raise so the gripper is directly above the drawer opening with clearance over the drawer edge.

50. The gripper with the red cube is raised and moving to the proper position above the drawer, thus: continue translating to center the gripper above the drawer.

51. The gripper is now properly positioned above the drawer with the cube clear of the lip, thus: open the gripper to release the red cube into the drawer.

52. The red cube has been released and seated in the drawer, thus: retract the gripper upward to clear the drawer.

53. The gripper is retracted and centered facing the open drawer, thus: begin the close-drawer protocol by moving such that the gripper can go down to the drawer’s level without collision.

54. The arm shifts to the drawer front to get into closing posture, thus: move down and rotate so the gripper is on the same level as the drawer front to prepare to push.

55. The gripper is aligned with the drawer front and ready to push, thus: push the drawer closed.

56. The drawer is now closed, thus: retract and return to the home position.

57. The arm is at the home position with the middle drawer closed and all items inside; the sequence is complete.
