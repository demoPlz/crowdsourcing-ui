Do the same with the following frames, which follow the frames from the previous query, to continue building the description bank. If, now given the next frames, the previous description or descriptions are incorrect, looking especially for incontinuity (for example, skipping steps when carrying out protocols, or doing something physically impossible), correct the previous description or descriptions (if generated and not copied from examples) to be rigorously continuous, and sequentially consistent. Output the description bank in full, including what you have outputted before or its modified version.
