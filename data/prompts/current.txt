Below we provide the four views the user is currently provided of the state they are to label. [gripper_description] Output a text prompt that describes what the user should do next following the second part of the state-action description format, after "thus:". Pick the most similar description in the description bank, taking similarity of context into consideration (what the previus and following descriptions are), prioritizing similarity of the skill/verb, then the specific objects/noun. The noun should be adapted to the views we provide here, instead of rigidly following the specific noun in the description bank. As a reminder, the task here is {task}. If the success conditions are fulfilled, output "end" in place of "text prompt". Output in the following form:

"text prompt", 26

Where the number is numbering of the selected text prompt from the description bank.
