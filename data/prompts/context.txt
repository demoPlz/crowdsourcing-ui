Consider a system where states from a robot manipulation task are shown to remote users, who in turn provide action labels for corresponding states. Those action labels are in the form of the next-best-pose or gripper open/close, which the robot will move linearly to attain, i.e. move in a straight line and/or rotate in a linear fashion to achieve the pose specified by the label.

The high level task here is {task}. The optimal strategy for executing this task is the following:

{strategy}

Common failure modes that may lead to deviations from the strategies and how to recover from each are as follows:

{failures}

I will show you pairs of consecutive keyframes from an example execution of this task. For each pair, add one description to the description bank that describes the transition from the first image to the second image. Each pair follows the previous pair, so the description bank describes the trajectory in order. If and only if there's only one image, and that image satisfies the success condition, then it is the end of the trajectory.

Use "state-action description format" as shown in the following examples, which corresponds exactly to the correct labels for the frames:

{sequence_description}

The description should be numbered sequentially (starting from where the previous description bank left off) and follow the format: "X. [State description], thus: [Action description]." If the success conditions are fulfilled, output "X. No objects are on the table. The middle drawer is closed. The robot is in home position, thus: end".

Only add ONE description per query to build the description bank incrementally. Although in light of subsequent frames, you can revise previous mislabeled descriptions.
