Please provide:\n\n- The task (e.g., pick-and-place, cable routing, tool use).\n- The optimal strategy you want followed.\n- The failure modes and recoveries you want demonstrated.\n- The sequence of keyframes (images or brief descriptions of each frame).\n\nIf you upload the keyframe images, I’ll annotate each with:\n- What happened (state change, success/failure).\n- The next step (action label: target pose and gripper open/close), assuming straight-line motion to the specified pose.\n\nIf it helps, you can use this quick template per frame:\n- Frame N: Observation (object/robot pose, gripper state, notable events).\n- Outcome: Success/Failure type.\n- Next action: Target pose (position + orientation, or relative move), gripper command (open/close), approach standoff if needed, and any recovery note.\n\nIf you prefer, tell me the domain and I can propose the strategy and failure recoveries before annotating the frames."
